My name is Rostislav Lispky, I'm student from Minsk, studying Artificial Intelligence at the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics.
Programming has been my hobby since I was 10 y.o. and I've always dreamed of becoming a software engineer. Now my dream is closer than ever.

My education and courses:
 - AI, BSUIR (Bachelor degree): 2021 - present
 - Introduction to Java, EPAM: 2021 - 2022

So, my main languages are Java and C++, I also use Python for some little automation tasks. I have some experience in programming, such as:
 - Library for clustering (Java, used in production)
 - Library for effective node connection in graphs (C++, used in production)
 - A utility to edit GRUB entries in BLS specification (C++)
 - VK bot for collecting statistics about communities (Python)
 - An application to automatically create schedule for my school (C#)
 - Copy of BSUIR website (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)
